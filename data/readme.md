# Here be datasets

Mamba and Transformer (TBD) will require pre-training data for our Q&A in Finance. Here we should create a script that will accumulate our chosen datasets and concatonate them into our custom fine-tuning (training) dataset. There should also be a utility that will present the dataset in formats suitable for either of the models' use.


1. accumulate data
2. concatonate data
3. present data

- Beware of cross-pollination
- Pick relevant datasets for our task
- yati yati yata...
